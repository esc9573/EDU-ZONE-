                <p id="sub1"><strong>1.1 Introduction to C# </strong></p>
                <p>We are going to learn a language called C# (pronounced C sharp). If you ever make the mistake of calling the language C hash you will show your ignorance straight away! C# is a very flexible and powerful programming language with an interesting
                    history. It was developed by Microsoft Corporation for a variety of reasons, some technical, some political and others marketing. C# bears a strong resemblance to the C++ and Java programming languages, having borrowed (or improved)
                    features provided by these languages. The origins of both Java and C++ can be traced back to a language called C, which is a highly dangerous and entertaining language which was invented in the early 1970s. C is famous as the language
                    the UNIX operating system was written in, and was specially designed for this.
                    <br> Definition of C# <br> C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, high-level programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000. It is an object-oriented, strongly typed language designed for building a wide range of applications,
                    including desktop, web, mobile, and gaming applications. C# is part of the .NET ecosystem and is widely used for developing Windows applications, cloud services, and backend systems.</p>

                <p id="sub2"><strong>1.2 Key Features of C#</strong></p>
                <p>C# offers several powerful features, such as: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.<br> Automatic Memory Management: Uses garbage collection to handle memory allocation and deallocation.
                    Type Safety: Prevents type-related errors at compile time. Asynchronous Programming: Supports async and await for efficient multitasking. Cross-Platform Development: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS via .NET Core.
                </p>


                <p id="sub3"><strong>1.3 What Comprises a C# Program? </strong></p>
                <p> If your mum wanted to tell you how to make your favourite fruitcake she’d write the recipe down on a piece of paper. The recipe would be a list of ingredients followed by a sequence of actions to perform on them. A program can be regarded
                    as a recipe, but written for a computer to follow, not a cook. The ingredients will be values (called variables) that you want your program to work with. The program itself will be a sequence of actions (called statements) that are
                    to be followed by the computer.<br> Rather than writing the program down on a piece of paper you instead put it into a file on the computer, often called a source file. This is what the compiler acts on. A source file contains three
                    things:
                    <br>1- instructions to the compiler <br>2- information about the structures which will hold the data to be stored and manipulated. <br>3- instructions which manipulate the data.</p>

                <p id="sub4"><strong>1.4  Simple Data Processing </strong></p>
                <p> n this chapter we are going to create a genuinely useful program (particularly if you are in the double glazing business).<br> We will start by creating a very simple solution and investigating the C# statements that perform basic data
                    processing. Then we will use additional features of the C# language to improve the quality of the solution we are producing.<br> The Program Example<br> Perhaps the best way to start looking at C# is to jump straight in with our first
                    ever C# program. Here it is:
                    <span class="span1"><br>using System;
                        <br>  class GlazerCalc
                        <br>   {
                            <br>   static void Main()
                            <br>   {
                                <br>   double width, height, woodLength, glassArea;
                                <br>   string widthString, heightString;
                                <br>   widthString = Console.ReadLine();
                        <br>    width = double.Parse(widthString);
                        <br>    heightString = Console.ReadLine();
                        <br>    height = double.Parse(heightString);
                        <br>     woodLength = 2 * ( width + height ) * 3.25 ;
                        <br>     glassArea = 2 * ( width * height ) ;
                        <br>     Console.WriteLine ( "The length of the wood is " +
                        <br>      woodLength + " feet" ) ;
                        <br>    Console.WriteLine( "The area of the glass is " +
                        <br>    glassArea + " square metres" ) ;
                        <br>    }
                        <br>    }</span>Code Sample 01 GlazerCalc Program This is a valid program. If you gave it to a C# compiler it would compile, and you could run it. The actual work is done by the two lines that I have highlighted.
                    Broadly speaking the stuff before these two lines is concerned with setting things up and getting the values in to be processed. The stuff after the two lines is concerned with displaying the answer to the user. </p>
                <br>
                <p id="sub5"><strong>1.5 using System   </strong></p>

                <p> C# is widely used in: <br>Desktop Applications: Built with Windows Forms or WPF.<br> Web Development: Using ASP.NET for backend services.<br> Game Development: Popular in Unity game engine.<br> Mobile Apps: Through Xamarin for cross-platform
                    apps. <br>Cloud & Microservices: Using Azure and .NET for scalable solutions.<br>This is an instruction to the C# compiler to tell it that we want to use things from the System namespace. A namespace is a place where particular names
                    have meaning.<br> We have namespaces in our conversations too, if I am using the "Football" namespace and I say “That team is really on fire” I'm saying something good. If I am using the "Firefighter" namespace I'm saying something
                    less good. In the case of C# the System namespace is where lots of useful things are described. One of these useful things provided with C# is the Console class which will let me write things which will appear on the screen in front
                    of the user. If I want to just refer to this as Console I have to tell the compiler I'm using the System namespace.<br> This means that if I refer to something by a particular name the compiler will look in System to see if there is
                    anything matching that name.<br> We will use other namespaces later on.

                <p>
                    We now know nearly everything you need to know about constructing a program in the C# language.<br> You may find it rather surprising, but there is really very little left to know about programming itself. Most of the rest of C# is
                    concerned with making the business of programming simpler. A good example of this is the switch construction.<br> How does a switch statement simplify multiple conditions?<br> Answer: The switch statement selects one of many code blocks
                    to execute based on a value.<br>
                    <span class="span1"><br>string day = "Monday";

                <p id="subbb1"><strong>3.1  What is a Function in C#?</strong></p>
                <p>In C#, functions are more commonly called methods, and they are one of the most important building blocks in the language. They allow you to group lines of code into one reusable block that you can run (or "call") whenever you need it.
                    Imagine you’re baking a cake . Instead of repeating all the steps every time you bake, you write a recipe. That recipe is like a function. You call it whenever you need it. In C#, a function lives inside a class, and it can perform
                    actions, return values, or do both.


                    <span class="span1"><br>returnType FunctionName(parameters)
                        <br>    {
                            <br> // code to execute
                            <br>    return value; // if returnType is not void
                            <br>   }
                        </span>

                <p id="subbb2"><strong>3.2  Objects and Structures  </strong></p>
                <p>In C# objects and structures have a lot in common. They can both hold data and contain methods. However, there is a crucial difference between the two. Structures are managed in terms of value whereas objects are managed in terms of reference.
                    It is very important that you understand the distinction between the two, for it has a big impact on the way that they are used.<br>
                    <span class="span1"><br>struct AccountStruct
                        <br>  {
                            <br> public string Name ;
                            <br> } ;
                            <br> class StructsAndObjectsDemo
                            <br> {
                                <br>  public static void Main ()
                                <br>  {
                                    <br>  AccountStruct RobsAccountStruct ;
                                    <br>   RobsAccountStruct.Name = "Rob";
                                    <br>   Console.WriteLine ( RobsAccountStruct.Name );
                                    <br>   }
                                    <br>   }

                <p id="subbb3"><strong>3.3 Why Use Functions?</strong></p>
                <p>Using functions is not just good programming practice, it's essential. Here’s why: <br>1. Reusability If you need to do the same task multiple times, you don’t want to copy and paste the same code everywhere. Just write a function once,
                    and call it whenever you need it.<br> 2. Modularity Functions help break your program into small, understandable pieces. Instead of one long piece of code that does everything, you have smaller blocks that each do one thing. This makes
                    the code easier to read, test, and debug. <br>3. Maintainability If a bug appears in a calculation that’s used many times, you only need to fix the bug inside the function. All parts of your program that use that function will now
                    use the corrected version.<br> 4. Clarity Naming a function gives meaning to what the code does. For example: CalculateSalary() is much clearer than just a chunk of math operations sitting in your Main().

                <p>You can make small common functions and combine them to build bigger ones. Example: Use CanVote() inside a larger function that registers users:<br><span class="span1"> <br>void RegisterUser()

                    Final Thoughts<br> Common functions are like tools in a toolbox. The more of them you build and reuse, the faster and smarter you code. They reduce bugs, save time, and make your code easier to read. In real-world applications, teams
                    often create a Helpers.cs file where they store all these useful utility methods to keep the main logic clean and focused.
